Disclaimer: 

This is a recipe I accidentally cobbled together from different bits from different places as we didn't have any 
cream during the great 2020 quarantine, the only originality I claim is the combination of the three parts (credit to my partner
Anca for suggesting the blueberry reduction). Turns out creme patissier works amazingly well as a filler for this swiss roll. 
You can also adapt to different baking tin sizes if you make sure to calculate the area ratio and adjust quantities accordingly.

### For the base

* 1 tbsp unsalted butter (for brushing)
* 35g cocoa powder (plus extra for dusting)
* 5 eggs, separated
* 150g caster sugar
* 1 tbsp plain flour 

* a 30x37cm rectangular baking tin

Preheat the oven to 220C and line the tin with baking parchment. Brush with butter and chill for 5 minutes. 
Evenly dust with cocoa powder, including on sides, tipping out any extra.

In a large bowl hand whisk the egg yolks with 100g of the caster sugar until incorporated and fluffy. In a separate bowl
whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks, then whisk in the sugar until it looks glossy.

Sift the cocoa powder and flour together in a small bowl.

In three rounds (portions) gradually incorporate the cocoa mixture and egg whites into the egg yolk mixture by folding gently, 
without squeezing the mixture so it remains aerated. Do this until combined then pour the resulting mixture into the tin and gently 
spread it out into an even layer.

Bake for 7-10 mins until a toothpick comes out clean. Remove and cool for 2 minutes in the tray then turn out onto a baking parchment 
dusted with cocoa powder. Slowly roll up the sponge in the parchment and allow to cool completely.

Once the filling is ready, unroll, spread both filling on top in two layers and re-roll carefully. If it disintegrates, don't 
cry, it'll still be amazingly tasty. Optionally if you don't want to go through the pain of rolling it, you can just cut it in 
half or thirds and layer it like a cake. Go crazy.

### For the creme patissiere

* 3 large (60g) egg yolks
* 5 tablespoons (65g) granulated sugar
* 1 1/2 tablespoons (15g) all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 tablespoons (15g) cornstarch
* 1 1/4 cups (300 ml) whole milk
* 1/2 vanilla bean , split and seeded, or 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

In a bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar just until pale yellow and creamy, then whisk in cornstarch and flour. 

In a medium saucepan, heat milk and vanilla pod or extract on medium heat just to a boil. Remove from heat (and remove vanilla 
bean if using). Gradually pour the hot milk into the egg mixture while simultaneously whisking constantly until smooth.

Transfer mixture back into saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly and vigorously so that the eggs won’t curdle, 
until mixture thickens. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the 
cream to prevent it from creating a ‘skin’. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until chilled.

### For the blueberry reduction

If you don't have blueberries I am super confident they can be replaced with strawberries, cherries or any other similar-ish fruit.

* 3 cups blueberries (fresh or frozen)
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch dissolved into 3 tablespoons water
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract


Place the blueberries in a small saucepan. Cover with water and add sugar and vanilla. Heat over medium-high heat until mixture 
comes to a low boil and blueberries just start to break apart. Add the dissolved cornstarch to saucepan and bring mixture to a 
simmer and stir continuously until sauce thickens sufficiently. You can add more water, one tablespoon at a time, if the sauce 
gets too thick.
